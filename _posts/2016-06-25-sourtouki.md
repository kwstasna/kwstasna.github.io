Sourtouki.gr is a Nightlife Platform for Greece.
It includes all the cities of Greece from Crete to Alexandroupoli and is trying to collect all the Nightlife Clubs, Bars, Cafe-Restaurant etc
so the users, even the tourists, can search among a vary of things like, Area, Category, Subcategory, Near his Location.

My job in this project was to make the Webpage of this Platform among with the iOS Application.

The result was the following.
